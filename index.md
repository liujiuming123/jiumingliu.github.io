## About Me (刘久铭)

I am a second-year master student at the [IRMV Lab](https://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/) in the [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Hesheng Wang](https://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/wanghesheng) and to collaborate with many wonderful lab members. My research interests include a wide range of 3D computer vision fields, especially how to perceive, comprehend, localize, render, and generate realistic 3D/4D worlds. From June to August in 2023, I also served as a research assistant in Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), advised by Prof. [Yunhui Liu](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liu-yun-hui/). During my master period, I have published **six international conference papers** in artificial intelligence and computer vision domains, including AAAI 2023, ICCV 2023, CVPR 2024, and ECCV 2024. I also actively served as the reviewer of top conferences like CVPR 2024, ECCV 2024, and NeurIPS 2024, and top journals like IJCV, IEEE TASE, etc. 

**Recently, I am looking for a PhD position, welcome to contact me at email: liujiuming@sjtu.edu.cn**.
